Distributions
-------------

Given in this section are distributions, as provided by the *Distributions* :cite:`bates:2014:DP` and *Mamba* packages, supported for the specification of :ref:`section-Stochastic` nodes.  Truncated versions of continuous univariate distributions are also supported.

A Flat distribution is supplied with the degenerate probability density function:

    f(x) \propto 1, \quad -\infty < x < \infty.

New known, unknown, or unnormalized univariate distributions can be created and added to *Mamba* as subtypes of the *Distributions* package ``ContinuousUnivariateDistribution`` or ``DiscreteUnivariateDistribution`` types.  *Mamba* requires only a partial implementation of the method functions described in the `full instructions for creating univariate distributions <http://distributionsjl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extends.html#create-a-univariate-distribution>`_.  The specific workflow is given below.

    #. Create a ``quote`` block for the new distribution.  Assign the block a variable name, say ``extensions``, preceded by the ``@everywhere`` macro to ensure compatibility when **julia** is run in multi-processor mode.

    #. The *Distributions* package contains types and method definitions for new distributions.  Load the package and import any of its methods (indicated below) that are extended.

    #. Declare the new distribution subtype, say ``D``, within the block.  Any constructors explicitly defined for the subtype should accept un-typed or abstract-type (``Real``, ``AbstractArray``, or ``DenseArray``) arguments.  Implementing constructors in this way ensures that they will be callable with the *Mamba* ``Stochastic`` and ``Logical`` types.

    #. Extend/define the following *Distributions* package methods for the new distribution ``D``.

        .. function:: minimum(d::D)

            Return the lower bound of the support of ``d``.

        .. function:: maximum(d::D)

            Return the upper bound of the support of ``d``.

        .. function:: logpdf(d::D, x::Real)

            Return the normalized or unnomalized log-density evaluated at ``x``.

    #. Test the subtype.

    #. Add the ``quote`` block (new distribution) to *Mamba* with the following calls.

        .. code-block:: julia

            using Mamba
            @everywhere eval(extensions)

Below is a univariate example based on the linear regression model in the :ref:`section-Line`.

Block-Diagonal Multivariate Normal Distribution
```````````````````````````````````````````````

A Block-Diagonal Multivariate Normal distribution is supplied with the probability density function:

.. math::

    f(\bm{x}; \bm{\mu}, \bm{\Sigma}) = \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^{d/2} |\bm{\Sigma}|^{1/2}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2} (\bm{x} - \bm{\mu})^\top \bm{\Sigma}^{-1} (\bm{x} - \bm{\mu})\right), \quad -\infty < \bm{x} < \infty,

where

.. math::

    \bm{\Sigma} = \begin{bmatrix}
        \bm{\Sigma_1} & \bm{0} & \hdots & \bm{0} \\
        \bm{0} & \bm{\Sigma_2} & \hdots & \bm{0} \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        \bm{0} & \bm{0} & \hdots & \bm{\Sigma}_m \\
    \end{bmatrix}.
